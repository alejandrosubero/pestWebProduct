    "productOverview": "Dual-action residual insecticide combining beta-cyfluthrin and imidacloprid for broad-spectrum control of crawling and flying pests indoors and outdoors. Designed for professional use, it delivers both quick knockdown and long-lasting residual activity in a single formulation.",
    "activeIngredients": "Beta-cyfluthrin 0.05% (synthetic pyrethroid insecticide), Imidacloprid 0.10% (neonicotinoid insecticide). Inert ingredients 99.85% including surfactants and stabilizers.",
    "howItWorks": "Beta-cyfluthrin acts on voltage-gated sodium channels in insect nerve membranes, causing paralysis and death. Imidacloprid binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to overstimulation and death. The combination provides dual modes of action to improve efficacy and resistance management.",
    "spectrumOfControl": "Controls a wide range of pests including ants, bed bugs, cockroaches, fleas, flies, silverfish, spiders, ticks, and wasps in both indoor and outdoor settings.",
    "applicationRates": "General dilution: 0.27–0.54 fl oz per gallon of water depending on target pest and infestation level. Maximum: 0.11 lb active ingredient per acre per year outdoors.",
    "applicationTips": "Apply as a spot, crack-and-crevice, or perimeter treatment. Use lower rates for maintenance and higher rates for heavy infestations. Avoid runoff into water systems. Agitate mixture during application to keep formulation evenly dispersed.",
    "Advantages": "Two activeIngredients for broad pest spectrum and resistance management, long residual control, indoor/outdoor versatility, and compatibility with integrated pest management (IPM) programs.",
    "safetyEnvironmentalNotes": "Toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, and pollinators; avoid contamination of water sources. Keep people and pets away from treated areas until sprays have dried. Wear protective clothing, gloves, and eye protection during mixing and application.",
    "whyTheseComponentsAreUsed": "Beta-cyfluthrin provides rapid knockdown and strong residual activity against crawling insects. Imidacloprid targets insects resistant to pyrethroids and adds systemic and ingestion activity. Surfactants ensure even spreading, while stabilizers maintain product integrity during storage.",

    "productOverview": "DeltaDust is a ready-to-use insecticidal dust formulation containing deltamethrin. It provides knockdown and long-term residual control of a wide variety of crawling insects. Labeled for use in residential, commercial, and industrial structures, including food-handling areas.",
    "activeIngredients": "Deltamethrin 0.05%. Other Ingredients 99.95%.",
    "howItWorks": "Deltamethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide that disrupts sodium channel function in insect neurons, causing paralysis and death. As a dust, it adheres to surfaces and pests pick up lethal doses through contact.",
    "spectrumOfControl": "Ants, cockroaches, fleas, crickets, firebrats, silverfish, termites, and many other crawling insects. May also be used in food-handling areas as crack/crevice or spot treatments.",
    "applicationRates": "Apply 2–3 g per sq yard (0.5 lb per 1000 sq ft). Apply to cracks, crevices, voids, wall spaces, and around pest harborages.",
    "applicationTips": "Apply with hand or power duster. Focus on cracks, voids, and hiding places. Do not apply to exposed surfaces. Avoid contamination of food. Do not apply in HVAC ducts that circulate air.",
    "Advantages": "Provides both knockdown and long residual control. Waterproof formulation. Effective against resistant cockroach strains.",
    "safetyEnvironmentalNotes": "Highly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. Toxic to bees if applied to blooming plants. Keep out of reach of children. Do not contaminate water sources.",
